# Getting Started with TrueConf SDK for Windows Samples

First of all you need to add TrueConf SDK component to Delphi's palette:

* Run callx\_setup.exe installer under administrator priveleges. 
* Open _RAD Studio_ (Delphi).
* Choose _Component_ -> _Import Component..._ from the main menu.
* Check _Import ActiveX Control_ and press _Next_.
* Find and select __TrueConf_CallXLi__ in ActiveX components list and press _Next_.
* Leave the default parameters intouch and continue with _Next_.
* Check _Install to New Package_ and press _Next_.

Congratulations, all set! __TrueConfCallX__ visual component has been added to _ActiveX_ tab of the palette. Now you can create and build projects from this directory.
